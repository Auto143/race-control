## About <a name = "about"></a>
Race Control is a free and open-source race data analysis application; written in C# using the Avalonia UI framework. The application will initially only analyse telemetry pulled from MyChron devices in a CSV format. However, compatibility may be expanded in the future. Race Control will also allow teams to keep a journal of race meets, allowing analysis of data gathered last time a team was at the circuit to help determine set up etc.
